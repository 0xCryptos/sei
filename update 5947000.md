# Chain upgrade to commit 1.2.0beta
## (OPTION 1) Manual upgrade
Once the chain reaches the upgrade height, you will encounter the following panic error message:\
`ERR UPGRADE "xxx" NEEDED at height: 5947000`
```
sudo systemctl stop seid
cd $HOME && rm $HOME/sei-chain -rf
git clone https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain.git && cd $HOME/sei-chain
git checkout $VERSION
make install
sudo systemctl restart seid && journalctl -fu seid -o cat
```

!!! DO NOT UPGRADE BEFORE CHAIN RECHES THE BLOCK `5947000`!!!
